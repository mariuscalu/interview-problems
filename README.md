#The Knight’s Dialer

##Description

> Imagine you place a knight chess piece on a phone dial pad. This chess piece moves in an uppercase “L” shape: two steps horizontally followed by one vertically, or one step horizontally then two vertically.
> Suppose you dial keys on the keypad using only hops a knight can make. Every time the knight lands on a key, we dial that key and make another hop. The starting position counts as being dialed.
> How many distinct numbers can you dial in N hops from a particular starting position?

##Example

* Given the following input: starting position: 6 hops: 2 the result should be 6
(6–1–8 | 6–1–6 | 6–7–2 | 6–7–6 | 6–0–4 | 6–0–6)

#Synonymous Queries

##Description

> Suppose you’re given two inputs. First, a list of pairs of strings representing synonyms where the two strings in the pair are synonymous with one another. Secondly, a list of pairs of strings representing queries
> Your task is to output a list of boolean values such that each entry in the output indicates whether the corresponding pair of queries are synonymous

##Example

Given the following synonyms: rate = ratings and approval = popularity. The following pair of queries: "obama approval rate", "obama popularity ratings" should be synonyms 

#Ratio Finder

##Description

>Given a list of conversion rates as a collection of origin unit, destination unit, and multiplier, such that
>ORIGIN * MULTIPLIER = DESTINATION, design an algorithm that takes two arbitrary unit values and returns the conversion rate between them

##Example

1 hand = 1.0737e-17 light years (1 hand equals 4 inches / 4 inches equals 0.33333 feet / 0.33333 feet equals 6.3125e-5 miles / 6.3125e-5 miles equals 1.0737e-17 light years)
